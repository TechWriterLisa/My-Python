### *  **2-1** Assign a message to a variable, and then print that message. 

### * **2-2** Assign a message to a variable, and then print that message.Then change the value of the varible to a new message, and print the new message.

### * **2-3** Use a variable to represent a person's name, and print a message to that person. Sample: "Hello Eric, Want to learn some python today?"


### * **2-4** Use a varible to represent a person's name, and then print that person's name in lowercase, uppercase, and title case.

### * **2-5** Print a famous quote and name the author.


```
Albert Einstein once said, "A person who never made a
mistake never tried anything new."
```

### * **2-6** Famous quote 2: RepeatExercise 2-5, but this time, represent the famous person'sname using a variable called famous_person. Then compose your message and represent it with a new variable called message. Print your message.

### * **2-7** Stripping Names: Use a variable to represent a person's name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name using each of the three stripping functions, lstrip(), rstrip(), and strip().

### * **2-8** Number Eight: Write addition, subtraction, mulitplication, and division operations that each result in the number 8. Be sure to enclose your operations in print() calls to see the results. You should create four lines that look like this:

```
print(5+3)
``` 
### Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8 appearing once on each line.


### * **2-9** Favorite Number: Use a variable to represent your favorite number. Then, using that variable, create a message that reveals your favorite number. Print that message.

### * **2-10** Adding Comments: Add comments to any program.


### * **2-11** Zen of Python: Enter *import this* into a python terminal session and skim through the additional principles.


### * **3-1** Names: Store the names of a few people in a list called names. Print each person's name by accessing each element in the list, one at a time.


### * **3-2** Greetings: Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just printing each person's name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person's name. 

### * **3-3** Your Own List: Think of your favorite mode of transporation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as "I would like to own a Honda motorcycle."

### * **3-4** If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people you’d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

### * **3-5** You just heard that one of your guests can’t make the dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations. You’ll have to think of someone else to invite.

### 1. Start with your program from Exercise 3-4. Add a print statement at the end of your program stating the name of the guest who can’t make it.
### 2. Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who can’t make it with the name of the new person you are inviting.
### 3. Print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person who is still in your list.

### * **3-6** You just found a bigger dinner table, so now more space is available. Think of three more guests to invite to dinner.

### 1. Start with your program from Exercise 3-4 or Exercise 3-5. Add a ```print ```statement to the end of your program informing people that you found a bigger dinner table.
### 2. Use ```insert()``` to add one new guest to the beginning of your list.
### 3. Use ```insert()``` to add one new guest to the middle of your list.
### 4. Use ```append()``` to add one new guest to the end of your list. Print a new set of invitation messages, one for each person in your list.

### * **3-7** You just found out that your new dinner table won’t arrive in time for the dinner, and you have space for only two guests.

### 1. Start with your program from Exercise 3-6. Add a new line that prints a message saying that you can invite only two people for dinner.
### 2. Use ```pop()``` to remove guests from your list one at a time until only two names remain in your list. Each time you pop a name from your list, print a message to that person letting them know you’re sorry you can’t invite them to dinner.
### 3. Print a message to each of the two people still on your list, letting them know they’re still invited.
### 4. Use ```del``` to remove the last two names from your list, so you have an empty list. Print your list to make sure you actually have an empty list at the end of your program.

### * **3-8** Think of at least five places in the world you’d like to visit. 
### 1. Store the locations in a list. Make sure the list is not in alphabetical order. 
### 2. Print your list in its original order. Don’t worry about printing the list neatly, just print it as a raw Python list. 
### 3. Use ```sorted()``` to print your list in alphabetical order without modifying the actual list. 
### 4. Show that your list is still in its original order by printing it. 
### 5. Use ```sorted()``` to print your list in reverse alphabetical order without changing the order of the original list.
### 6. Show that your list is still in its original order by printing it again.
### 7. Use ```reverse()``` to change the order of your list. Print the list to show that its order has changed.
### 8. Use ```reverse()``` to change the order of your list again. Print the list to show it’s back to its original order.
### 9. Use ```sort()``` to change your list so it’s stored in alphabetical order. Print the list to show that its order has been changed.
### 10. Use ```sort()``` to change your list so it’s stored in reverse alphabetical order. Print the list to show that its order has changed.

### * **3-9** Working with one of the programs from Exercise 3-4 through 3-7, use ```len()``` to print a message indicating the number of people you are inviting to dinner.

### * **3-10** Think of something you could store in a list. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, language, or anything else you'd like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items and then uses each function introduced in this chapter at least once.

### * **3-11** If you haven't received an index error in one of your programs yet, try to make one happen. Change an index in one of your programs to produce an index error. Make sure you correct the error before closing the program.

### * **4-1** Think of at least three kinds of your favorite pizza. Store these pizza names in a list, and then use a for loop to print the name of each pizza.

### 1. Modify your for loop to print a sentence using the name of the pizza instead of printing just the name of the pizza. For each pizza you should have one line of output containing a simple statement like I like pepperoni pizza.
### 2. Add a line at the end of your program, outside the for loop, that states how much you like pizza. The output should consist of three or more lines about the kinds of pizza you like and then an additional sentence, such as I really love pizza!

### * **4-2** Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic. Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a ```for``` loop to print out the name of each animal.
### 1. Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as A dog would make a great pet.
### 2. Add aline at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common. You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!

### * **4-3** Use a for loop to print the numbers from 1 to 20, inclusive.

### * **4-4** Make a list of the numbers from one to one million, and then use a ```for``` loop to print the numbers. (If the output is taking too long, stop it by pressing CTRL-C or by closing the output windows.)

### * **4-5** Make a list of the numbers from one to one million, and then use ```min()``` and ```max()``` to make sure your list actually starts at one and ends at one million. Also, use the ```sum()``` function to see how quickly Python can add a million numbers.

### * **4-6** Use the third argument of the ```range()``` function to make a list of the odd numbers from 1 to 20. Use a ```for``` loop to print each number.

### * **4-7** Make a list of the multiples of 3 from 3 to 0. Use a for loop to print the numbers in your list.

### * **4-8** A number raised to the third power is called a cube. For example, the cube of 2 is written as ```2**3``` in Python. Make a list of the first 10 cubes (that is, the cube of each integer from 1 through 10), and use a ```for``` loop to print out the value of each cube.

### * **4-9** Use a list comprehension to generate a list of the first 10 cubes.

### * **4-10** Using one of the programs you wwrote in this chapter, add several lines to the end of the program that do the following:
### 1. Print the message The first three items in the list are: . Then use a slice to print the first three items from that program's list.
### 2. Print the message Three items from the middle of the list are:. Use a slice to print three items fromt he middle of the list.
### 3. Print the message The last three items in the list are:. Use a slice to print the last three items in the list. 

### * **4-11** Start with your program from Exercise 4-1 (page 60). Make a copy of the list of pizzas, and call it ```friend_pizzas```. Then, do the following:

### 1. Add a new pizza to the original list.
### 2. Add a different pizza to the list ```friend_pizzas```.
### 3. Prove that you have two separate lists. Print the message, My favorite pizzas are:, and then use a for loop to print the first list. Print the message, My friend’s favorite pizzas are:, and then use a for loop to print the second list. Make sure each new pizza is stored in the appropriate list.

### * **4-12** All versions of foods.py in this section have avoided using ```for``` loops when printing to save space. Choose a version of foods.py and write two ```for``` loops to print each list of foods. 

### * **4-13** A buffet-style restaurant offers only five basic foods. Think of five simple foods, and store them in a tuple.

### 1. Use a for loop to print each food the restaurant offers.
### 2. Try to modify one of the items, and make sure that Python rejects the change.
### 3. The restaurant changes its menu, replacing two of the items with different foods. Add a block of code that rewrites the tuple, and then use a for loop to print each of the items on the revised menu.

### * **4-14** Look through the original PEP 8 style guide.

### * **4-15** Choose three of the programs you've written in this chapter and modify each one to comply with PEP 8.
### 1. Use four spaes for each indentation level. Set your text editor to insert four spaces every time you press TAB, if you haven't already done so (see Appendix B).
### 2. Use less than 80 characters on each line, and set your editor to show a vertical guideline at the 80th character position.
### 3. Don't use blank lines excessively in your program files.

### * **5-1** Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your preiction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:

```
car = 'subaru'
print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
print(car == 'subaru')

print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
print(car == 'audi')
```
1. Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.
2. Create at least ten tests. Have at least five tests evaluate to True and another five tests evaluate to False.

### * **5-2** You don't have to limit the number of tests you create to ten. If you want to try more comparisons, write more tests and add them to conditional_tests.py. Have at least one True and one False result for each of the following:
### 1. Tests for equality and inequality with strings.
### 2. Tests using the *lower()* method.
### 3. Numerical tests involving equality and inequality, greater than and less than, greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to.
### 4. Tests using the *and* keyword and the *or* keyword.
### 5. Test whether an item is in a list.
### 6. Test whether an item is not in a list.


### * **5-3** Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called *alien_color* and assign it a value of *'green'*, *'yellow'*, or *'red'*.

### 1. Write an *if* statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.

### 2. Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another tha fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)

### * **5-4** Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 5-3, and write an *if-else* chain.

### 1. If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.
### 2. If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.
### 3. Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.

### * **5-5** Turn your *if-else* chain from Exercise 5-4 into an *if-elif-else* cahin.

### 1. If the alien is green, print a message that the player earned 5 points.
### 2. If the alien is yellow, print a message that the player earned 10 points.
### 3. If the alien is red, print a message that the player earned 15 points.
### 4. Write three versions of this program, making sure each message is printed for the appropriate color alien.

### * **5-6** Write an *if-elif-else* chain that determines a person’s stage of life. Set a value for the variable *age*, and then:

### 1. If the person is less than 2 years old, print a message that the person is a baby.
### 2. If the person is at least 2 years old but less than 4, print a message that the person is a toddler.
### 3. If the person is at least 4 years old but less than 13, print a message that the person is a toddler.
### 4. If the person is at least 13 years old but less than 20, print a message that the person is a toddler.
### 5. If the person is at least 20 years old but less than 65, print a message that the person is a toddler.
### 6. If the person is age 65 or older, print a message that the person is an elder.


### * **5-7** Make a list of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of independent *if* statements that check for certain fruits in your list.

### 1. Make a list of your three favorite fruits and call it *favorite_fruits*.
### 2. Write five *if* statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is in your list. If the fruit is in your list, the *if* block should print a statement, such as You really like bananas!

### * **5-8** Make a list of five or more usernnames, including the name *'admin'*. Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user after they log in to a website. Loop through the list, and print a greeting to each user:

### 1. If the username is *'admin'*, print a special greeting, such as Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?
### 2. Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as Hello Eric, thank you for loggin in again.


### * **5-9** Add an if test to hello_admin.py to make sure the list of users is not empty.

### 1. If the list is emtpy, print the message We need to find some users!
### 2. Remove all of the usernames from your list, and make sure the correct message is printed.

### * **5-10** Do the following to create a program that simulates how websites ensure that everyone has a unique username.

### 1. Make a list of five or more usernames called *current_users*. Make another list of five usernames called *new_users*. Make sure one or two of the new usernames are also in the *current_users* list.
### 2. Loop through the *new_users* list to see if each new username has already been used. If it has, print a message that the person will need to enter a new username. If a username has not been used, print a message saying that the username is available.
### 3. Make sure your comparison is case insensitive. If 'John' has been used, *'JOHN'* should not be accepted.


### * **5-11** Ordinal numbers indicate their position in a list, such as 1st or 2nd. Most ordinal numbers end in th, except 1, 2, and 3.

### 1. Store the numbers 1 through 9 in a list.
### 2. Loop through the list.
### 3. Use an *if-elif-else* chain inside the loop to print the proper ordinal ending for each number. Your output should read *"1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th"*, and each result should be on a separate line.

### * **6-1** Use a dictionary to store information about a person you know. Store their first name, last name, age, and the city in which the live. You should have keys such as first_name, last_name, age, and city. Print each piece of information stored in your dictionary.

### * **6-2** Use a dictionary to store people's favorite numbers. Think of five names, and use them as keys in your dictionary. Think of a favorite number for each person, and store each as a value in your dictionary. Print each person's name and their favorite number. For even more fun, poll a few friends and get some actual data for your program.

### * **6-3** A Python dictionary can be used to model an actual dictionary. However, to avoid confusion, let's call it a glossary.

### * Think of five programming words you've learned about in the previous chapters. Use these words as the keys in your glossary, and store their meanings as values.

### * Print each word and its meaning as neatly formatted output. You might print the word followed by a colon and then its meaning, or print the word on one line and then print its meaning indented on a second line. Use the newline character (\n) to insert a blank line between each word-meaning pair in your output. 

### * **6-4** Now that you know how to  loop through a dictionary, clean up the code from Exercise 6-3 by replacing your series of print() calls with a loop that runs through the dictionary's keys and values. When you're sure that your loop works, add five more python terms to your glossary. When you run your program again, these new words and meanings should automatically be included in the output.

### * **6-5** Make a dictionary containing three major rivers and the country each river runs through. One key-value pair might be 'nile':'egypt'.

### * Use a loop to print a sentence about each river, such a *"The Nile runs through Egypt"*.

### * Use a loop to print the name of each river included in the dictionary.

### * Use a loop to print the name of each country included in the dictionary.

 
### * **6-6** Use the code in favorite_languages.py (page 97).

### * Make a list of people who should take the favorite languages poll. Include some names that are already in the dictionary and some that are not.

### * Loop through the list of people who should take the poll. If they have already taken the poll, print a message thanking them for responding. If they have not yet taken the poll, print a message inviting them to take the poll.

### * **6-7** Start with the program you wrote for Exercise 6-1. Make two new dictionaries representing different people, and store all three dictionaries in a list called people. Loop through your list of people. As you loop through the list, print everything you know about each person. 

### * **6-8** Make several dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a different pet. In each dictionary, include the kind of animal and the owner's name. Store these dictionaries in a list called pets. Next, loop through your list and as you do, print everything you know about each pet.

### * **6-9** Make a dictionary called favorite_places. Think of three names to use as keys in the dictionary, and store one to three favorite places for each person. To make this exercise a bit more interesting, ask some friends to name a few of their favorite places. Loop through the dictionary, and print each person's name and their favorite places.

### * **6-10** Modify your program from Exercise 6-2 so each person can have more than one favorite number. Then print each person's name along with their favorite numbers.
 
### * **6-11** Make a dictionary called cities. Use the names of three cities as keys in your dictionary. Create a dictionary of information about each city and include the country that the city is in, its approximate population, and one fact about that city. The kys for each city's dictionary should be something like country, population and fact. Print the name of each city and all of the information you have stored about it.

### * **6-12** We're now working with examples that are complex enough that they can be extended in any number of ways. Use one the the example programs from this chapter, and extend it by adding new keys and values, changing the context of the program or improving the formatting of the output.	

### * **7-1** Write a program that asks the user what kind of rental car they would like. Print a message about that car, such as"Let me see if I can find you a Subaru."

### * **7-2** Write a progarm that asks the user how many people are in their dinner group. If the answer is more than eight, print a message saying they'll have to wait for a table. Otherwise, report that their table is ready.

### * **7-3** Ask the user for a number, and then report whether the number is a multiple of 10 or not.

### * **7-4** Write a loop that prompts the user to enter a series of pizza toppings until they enter a 'quit' value. As they enter each topping, print a message saying you'll add that topping to their pizza.


### * **7-5** A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a person's age. If a person is under the age of 3, the tiket is free; if they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10; and if they are over age 12, the ticket is $15. Write a loop in which you ask users their age, and then tell them the cost of their movie ticket.

### * **7-6** Write different versions of either Exercise 7-4 or Exercise 7-5 that do each of the following at least once.

### * Use a conditional test in the while statement to stop the loop.

### * Use an active variable to control how long the loop runs.

### * Use a break statement to exit the loop when the user enters a 'quit' values.

### * **7-7** Write a loop that never ends, and run it. (To end the loop, press Ctrl-C or close the window displaying the output.)

### * **7-8** Make a list called sandwich_order and fill it with the names of various sandwiches. Then make an empty list called finished_sandwiches. Loop through the list of sandwich orders and print a message for each order, such as I made your una sandwich. As each sandwich is made, move it to the list of finished sandwiches. After all the sandwiches have been made, print a message listing each sandwich that was made.

### * **7-9** Using the list sandwich_orders from Exercise 7-8, make sure the sandwich 'pastrami' appears in the list at least three times. Add ode near the beginning of your program to print a message saying the deli has run out of pastrami, and then use a while loop to remove all ocurrences of 'pastrami' from sandwich_orders. Make sure no pastrami sandwiches end up in finished_sandwiches.

### * **7-10** Write a program that polls users about their ddream vacation. Write a prompt similar to If you could visit one place in the world, where would you go? include a block of code that prints the results of the poll.
