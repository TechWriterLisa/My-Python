### * **3-4** If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.
invitesList=['Lisa Adams', 'Dee Adams', 'Rita Adams', 'Dan Adams']
for count in range(len(invitesList)):
    print(f'{invitesList[count]}, you are invited to dinner.')
